We might even accidentally remove some print() calls that were being used for nonlog messages. The nice thing about log         messages is that you're free to fill your program with as many as you like, and you can always disable them later by           adding a single logging.disable(logging.CRITICAL) call. Unlike print(), the logging module makes it easy to switch             between showing and hiding log messages."
